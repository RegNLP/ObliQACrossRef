Rule 6.2.16(1)(e)(vi) recognises that some Recognised Investment Exchanges using, for example, anonymous order books or anonymous indications of interest, allow for the identity of counterparties to sometimes be unknown prior to the effecting of transactions.

Rule 6.2.16 also accepts that some participants in the Price Stabilisation may have accrued uneconomic positions during Price Stabilisation and therefore permits a single transaction, probably at the end-of-day, to square-off the positions between participants. The terms on which these transactions can be carried may often be agreed in the terms of engagement between the Stabilisation Manager and the Stabilisation Agents.  The Regulator may when inspecting records kept relating to Price Stabilisation seek the rationale for any of these transactions and the price at which they were conducted.

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism
The use of Virtual Assets raises significant regulatory concerns for regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies worldwide, particularly in relation to Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorism Financing (TF).  International bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the International Organisation for Securities Commissions (IOSCO), have issued different Digital Asset (including Virtual Asset and ICO) warnings to investors and market participants advising of the significant risks, including ML and TF risks, and the possibility of Digital Assets being used for wider illegal purposes.

Pursuant to section 50 of FSMR,  the FSRA is required to maintain the Official List, and may admit to the Official List such Securities as it considers appropriate.  It is important to note that, pursuant to section 50 of FSMR, only the FSRA can maintain an Official List of Securities, and neither Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) nor any other entity within ADGM are able to maintain their own Official List of Securities.  Section 50 of FSMR further provides that in maintaining the Official List, the FSRA may refer to itself as the Listing Authority.  For this purpose, Chapter 7 of MKT sets out the Rules applicable to Market Disclosure or otherwise known as its continuous disclosure framework.  This Guidance sets out the Listing Authoritys expectations in relation to its continuous disclosure framework, and provides guidance to Reporting Entities to assist their decision making in relation to their continuous disclosure obligations.

Other Reporting Entity steps to assist with compliance with Rule 7.2.1
Steps or actions that a Reporting Entity can take to help manage its disclosure obligations under Rule 7.2.1 include:

a)	To allow a Reporting Entity to urgently request a Trading Halt without delay, having a template letter ready for use at all times requesting the Listing Authority to grant a Trading Halt.

b)	Anticipating what might happen if the Inside Information leaks about a confidential transaction being negotiated, and have a template Disclosure ready that can be finalised and Disclosed straight away.

c)	Where it has advance notice of an event that is likely to require Disclosure under Rule 7.2.1, preparing a draft Disclosure ahead of time, allowing it to be Disclosed immediately.

d)	Where the event that gives rise to the need to make a Disclosure is within its control, being sensitive to the RIE’s market (upon which the Listed Entity’s Securities are admitted to trading) trading hours and, where possible, looking to ensure the event happens and the Disclosure is made before trading commences  or after trading closes (so as to avoid any disruption to the normal course of trading of the Listed Entity’s Securities of the’RIE's market).

e)	Ensuring that it, and its relevant Officers responsible for communication with the Listing Authority, has the:

(i)	organisational knowledge to have relevant and meaningful discussions on Rule matters; and

When the Listing Authority has concerns that a Reporting Entity may not have Disclosed Inside Information at the time it should have under Rule 7.2.1, it will typically issue an ‘aware letter’ to the Reporting Entity.  The purpose of an ‘aware letter’ is to enable the Listing Authority, and the market in the Listed Entity’s Securities, to be satisfied that the Reporting Entity is in compliance with its continuous disclosure obligations under the Rules.  Aware letters are issued under Rule 2.8.2.  A Reporting Entity must respond to an ‘aware letter’ by the time specified by the Listing Authority in the letter.

In regard to Rule 7.2.1, the first question that an Officer of a Reporting Entity should therefore consider is whether the Reporting Entity is aware of any Inside Information.  If yes, that Officer must consider, immediately,  whether that Inside Information must be Disclosed.  Suitable systems and procedures must therefore be implemented by a Reporting Entity to ensure that Inside Information is promptly identified by, or within, a Listed Entity (in light of the awareness extension discussed in paragraph 38 above) and a decision is taken as to whether a Disclosure is required.

The extension of a Reporting Entity’s ‘awareness’ to include information that its Officers ‘ought reasonably have come into possession of’ (over and above information that its Officers, in fact, ‘know’) means that a Reporting Entity is considered to be ‘aware’ of Inside Information if the information is known by anyone within the Listed Entity, and is of such significance that it ought reasonably to have been brought to the attention of an Officer of the Listed Entity.  Without this extension to the concept of ‘awareness’, a Reporting Entity would be able to avoid, or delay, meeting its continuous disclosure obligations in circumstances where Inside Information had not been brought to the attention of its Officers in a timely manner by others within the Listed Entity.  A Listed Entity will need to ensure that it has in place internal systems, processes and controls to ensure that Inside Information is promptly brought to the attention of its Officers.

Pursuant to section 50 of FSMR,  the FSRA is required to maintain the Official List, and may admit to the Official List such Securities as it considers appropriate.  It is important to note that, pursuant to section 50 of FSMR, only the FSRA can maintain an Official List of Securities, and neither Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) nor any other entity within ADGM are able to maintain their own Official List of Securities.  Section 50 of FSMR further provides that in maintaining the Official List, the FSRA may refer to itself as the Listing Authority.  For this purpose, Chapter 7 of MKT sets out the Rules applicable to Market Disclosure or otherwise known as its continuous disclosure framework.
