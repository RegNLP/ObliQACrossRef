Disclosure of material estimates of Petroleum Reserves It is important to note that to the extent an estimate of Petroleum Reserves involves a representation about future matters, it must be based on reasonable grounds. This means that any economic assumptions used to calculate the estimate must be objectively reasonable, or the representation could otherwise be deemed as misleading and the Petroleum Reporting Entity could face serious legal consequences as a result. In this regard, Petroleum Reporting Entities should take note of section 69 of FSMR (Statements about future matters) which provides that a person is taken to make a misleading or deceptive statement about a future matter if, at the time of making the statement, that person did not have reasonable grounds for making the statement.", "target_passage_id": "c7e8bce4-0757-4052-b618-aedbbe7000a8", "target_text": "Misleading and deceptive statements or omissions.
